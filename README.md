# reconocer

tool for recognizing recurrence relations to derive 
* general nth term
* partial sums

inspired by [this blog post](http://www.ryanhmckenna.com/2015/06/automatically-finding-recurrence.html)

## usage

* full example of linear homogenous equation of degree 2

* verify by calling via prolog

* also, does simpler stuff like arithmetic and geometric series

* how does it deal with overlap? it uses cuts and has an order of recognition

* special sequences are checked first, example is tiling 2x1 is Catalan numbers and same with 65 other problems (link it)
